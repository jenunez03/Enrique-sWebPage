        <h3>How It All Began</h3>
        <section class="box">I've been fascinated with paint after I had my first college trip at the Metropolitan Museum in NY, USA. I felt enlighted by seeing how art has evolved during the years, and I wanted to be part of it. So I decided to learn as much as I could on tutorials, also mistakes were a great teacher when I started. Now, I strive to work on anything that helps me to grow as a person, and I have realized that working with art is a great way to heal and to meditate on the things sometime we overlook and we ignore.  </section>

        <h3>Description</h3>        
        <section class="box">I try to work with topics that are around my life, thinks I am feeling or expericing. I want to show to people a bit what my inner world is about, sometimes is hard to express with words, but with painting you can tell right away what's going on. </section>
            </div>
            <div>
        <h3>Process</h3>         
        <section class="box">My paintings are made with oil paint making it more vivid, and a bit realistic. However, I've work other mediums like acrylis, watercolor, pastel crayons etc, I always come back to work with oil paint, I feel like it is my thing and I feel more experience with it.

    <section class="title">Autumn leaves at Cheshire, CT</section>
    <section class="date1">October, 2021</section>
    <p>Autumn goes away in a blink of an eye. This painting shows one of my favorite places where I have experienced happiness and good people have surrounded me. </p>
    <p> I teleport to that place When I see this artwork. Deep recollection, meditation, and peacefulness are what bring up this painting. </p>
